# conin

A python library that supports the constrained analysis of probabilistic graphical models

## Overview

Conin supports constrained inference and learning for hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, dynamic Bayesian networks and Markov networks. Conin interfaces with the pgmpy python library for the specification of general probabilistic graphical models. Additionally, it interfaces with a variety of optimization solvers to support learning and inference.
